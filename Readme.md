	Create a shortcut for the launcher and always launch the game through this instead of the updater since it will overwrite our ddraw.dll

<h1>Usage</h1>
	ALT+ENTER toggles fullscreen.
	Click then drag anywhere within the top ~16 px of the window to reposition
	in borderless windowed mode.
	The game window will automatically snap to the edges of the screen
	while repositioning. To prevent this from happening, hold SHIFT while
	dragging the window.
