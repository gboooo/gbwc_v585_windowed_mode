```
Create a shortcut for the launcher.
Never launch the game from the updater since it will overwrite our ddraw.dll.
```

### Usage
```
ALT+ENTER toggles fullscreen.
Click then drag anywhere within the top ~16 px of the window to reposition
in borderless windowed mode.
The game window will automatically snap to the edges of the screen
while repositioning. To prevent this from happening, hold SHIFT while
dragging the window.
```
